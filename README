		   NETWORK PACKET PARSER 
		------------------------------

What is it ?
------------

This is a parser which parses a pcap file(tcp/arp/http ) and displays the content
in a proper readable format.

Usage(On Linux) -
----------------

Compile the code using lpcap.

Input to the program is the pcap file name passed as a command line argument.

	Usage - gcc PacketParser.c <filename.c> -lpcap
		./a.out <filename.pcap>
			
	Eg    - gcc PacketParser.c -lpcap
		./a.out tcp-ecn-sample.pcap

A menu is displayed from which the user can choose the following 3 options:
	1) Full Summary
	2) Selected Packet Summary
	3) Exit

For Selected Packet Summary, the desired packet number is asked for. 
			

Implementation -
----------------

Language Used - C

The code is divided into 2 modules:

1) Parsing the ethernet header
   ----Using the structures declared initially, the ethernet header is parsed and Destination Addr, Source Addr and type are parsed and displayed.

2) Displaying th details of (TCP/ARP) headers with data dump
   ----Based on the ether type, the IP and TCP OR the ARP headers are parsed and details like Src IP, checksum, header lengths, hardware type etc are displayed.

NOTE:
In the data dump, the headers are seperately displayed in hex and the data payload is displayed in readable format.
